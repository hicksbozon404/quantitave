    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Calm Harmony" - Using warm neutrals (amber, stone) for the background and base, with a professional and calming blue as the primary accent for interactive elements and highlights. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application with a tab-based navigation. This structure was chosen to logically segment the distinct tools (EOQ, ROP, Metrics, ABC Analysis) and the new learning content (Notes, Questions). This task-oriented design allows a user (student) to focus on one concept, its calculations, or practice questions at a time, which is more effective for learning and exam preparation. The flow encourages interaction with each calculator to understand cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., how changing holding cost affects EOQ) and provides immediate feedback for quiz questions. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - EOQ Model: Goal is to visualize the cost trade-off. Method is an interactive calculator with a Chart.js line chart showing Holding, Ordering, and Total Cost curves. This visual relationship is key to understanding the EOQ concept. Interaction is real-time updates of the chart and result as user types.
        - ROP/Safety Stock: Goal is to clarify when to order and the need for a buffer. Method is a simple calculator with clear input/output fields. Interaction is instant calculation to demonstrate the impact of lead time and demand variability.
        - Performance Metrics: Goal is to calculate key efficiency ratios. Method is a calculator for ITR and DSI. Interaction provides immediate feedback on performance.
        - ABC Analysis: Goal is to show item categorization by value. Method is an interactive table where users can input data. A Chart.js pie chart visualizes the value distribution, reinforcing the Pareto Principle.
        - Notes & Explanations: Goal is to provide concise study material. Method is structured text with clear headings. No direct interaction beyond scrolling, serving as a reference.
        - Exam Standard Questions: Goal is to provide interactive practice.
            - Theory MCQs: Method is dynamically generated questions with radio buttons. Interaction includes immediate feedback on correctness, and detailed explanations for *wrong* answers, encouraging active learning and correction.
            - Calculation Questions: Method is all questions displayed. Interaction is a "Show Answer" button that reveals a step-by-step, detailed solution, allowing self-assessment.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. All visuals are implemented with Chart.js on Canvas elements or structured HTML/CSS.
